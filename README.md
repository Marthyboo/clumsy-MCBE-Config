# clumsy

__clumsy makes your network condition on Windows significantly worse, but in a managed and interactive manner.__



* No installation.
* No need for proxy setup or code change in your application.
* System wide network capturing means it works on any application.
* Works even if you're offline (ie, connecting from localhost to localhost).
* Your application keeps running, while clumsy can start and stop anytime.
* Interactive control how bad the network can be, with enough visual feedback to tell you what's going on.

See [this page](http://jagt.github.io/clumsy) for more info and build instructions.
